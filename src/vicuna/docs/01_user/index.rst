Vicuna User Guide
=================

This User Guide is intended for developers who wish to integrate Vicuna into a hardware design,
or who simply want to evaluate the performance improvements that a vector coprocessor can provide.

Skip ahead to the :doc:`prerequisites` to get started
by installing the tools required to work with Vicuna first,
then move on to the :doc:`configuration` section
to get an overview of Vicuna's extensive configuration options.

Before running benchmarks or starting to develop applications,
you might want to have a look at the :doc:`limitations`
to understand which factors influence the performance and efficiency
of vector code executing on Vicuna.
