Info: Cellview Rev Num:99,  Tech Rev Num:59

WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'hfaroo9_digital' is attached to the technology library 'tsmcN65'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /ece498hk/libs/T65GP_RFMIM_2fF_1P0V_2P5V_1p9m_6X1Z1U_ALRDL_OA61_PDK/tsmcN65/tsmcN65.layermap

INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the viaMap option. If a viaMap file, corresponding techfile or technology library exist, then use the -viaMap option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design. For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

This is because either the refLibList option is used and the cellview is available in the reference library 'tsmc065_rvt_stdcells' or the STRUCTURE is not mapped to the target library using the cell map file/piCellMap SKILL function. Therefore, all the instances of the cellview will be referenced from 'tsmc065_rvt_stdcells/FILL16A10TR/layout'.
