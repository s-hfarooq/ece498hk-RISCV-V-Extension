Info: Cellview Rev Num:99,  Tech Rev Num:59

WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'hfaroo9_digital' is attached to the technology library 'tsmcN65'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /ece498hk/libs/T65GP_RFMIM_2fF_1P0V_2P5V_1p9m_6X1Z1U_ALRDL_OA61_PDK/tsmcN65/tsmcN65.layermap

INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the viaMap option. If a viaMap file, corresponding techfile or technology library exist, then use the -viaMap option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design. For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
